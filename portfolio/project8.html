        <h4>Project Overview</h4>
        <p>
          Photospace is a freelance project that I’ve worked with a client to
          research, design, and develop a website where photographers can
          showcase their best work for potential clients. This web application
          serves to connect professional photographers to clients looking for
          quality prints. Photospace fosters a collaborative medium for
          photographers to learn and network with other professionals by sharing
          their experiences. Over the course of the project, I was responsible
          for project planning, design, and the programming skills needed to
          implement a working prototype.
        </p>
        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        <p>
          Photography is an extremely competitive field that requires talent,
          skills, marketing, and discipline to distinguish oneself as a
          professional photographer. Freelance creative professionals initially
          struggle to get the clients and referrals they need to thrive in their
          small businesses. Photographers early in their profession often lack
          access to a network of other creatives that provide opportunities for
          referrals and new ideas to occur.
        </p>
        <h4>User Research and Needfinding</h4>
        <p>
          The demographic I was targeting were business owners who are
          professional photographers. I interviewed a freelance photographer and
          he stressed that he was not attracting enough clients. The
          photographer is slowly making their mark in their profession and wants
          to collaborate with other creatives. Below are the most pertinent
          needs that I have gathered from the interview:
        </p>
        <div class="needfind">
          <ul>
            <li>Book more clients</li>
            <li>
              Network with other creatives to share knowledge, camera gear
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          By considering the user needs, the goal is to design a platform for
          professional photographers to interact with potential clients and
          other freelancing creatives.
        </p>

        <h4>Low-Fidelity Prototypes</h4>
        <p>
          The second stakeholder to the platform is a user looking for
          photography services. Once a user arrives on the front page, they can
          browse for the type of services they are looking for, see profiles of
          local freelancers near their area. Users also have the option to book
          small business owners and connect with them in the business profile
          area. Another top need that freelancers voiced was the desire to share
          information and equipment with other business owners. By fostering a
          collaborative blogging medium, creatives are encouraged to form a
          healthy relationship and potentially acquire more referrals.

          <img src="../img/pic2.png" alt="lowfidelity2" />
        </div>
        <div class="imgfloater">
          <img src="../img/pic3.png" alt="lowfidelity3" style="float: left;" />
          <img src="../img/pic4.png" alt="lowfidelity4" />
        </div>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
          The primary goal prior to beginning the programming phase was to
          understand what features were most beneficial to my stakeholders.
          Freelance photographers are looking to book more clients while having
          a medium to network with other creatives to share knowledge and camera
          equipment. The UI had to be simplistic and intuitive, and some
          features that I felt was needed did not align with user goals. For
          example, I decided that the ability to like/love a picture is not
          conducive to the main purpose of PhotoSpace. Users seeking
          photographer services can get a quick snapshot of each freelancer’s
          specialties and book them in as little clicks as possible. The website
          features a photo collection and testimonials for each business owner.
          Professional photographers looking for connections can interact with
          other freelancers, through the light blogging medium and comments area
          which maintains engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The BlogSpace is a medium for the business to provide commentary on
          photography and another opportunity to connect with clients. The page
          can allow the photographer to establish meaningful relationships with
          existing clients and other freelancers looking to obtain knowledge.
