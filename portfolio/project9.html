          <h4>Project Overview</h4>
          <p>
            BabyVice is an app that helps new parents become outstanding
            parents. I worked in a team to design a platform where parents can
            gain insight into their baby’s maturation process, keep track of
            their baby’s changes and are alerted of upcoming milestones and
            checkups. Users can also share their progress by interacting with
            the community along with other new parents.
          </p>
          <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
          <p>
            New parents are often ill prepared for the difficulties of raising a
            child. Being a parent can be a challenge and keeping up on their
            baby’s developmental stages is a priority for most. New parents have
            access to overwhelming amounts of information from numerous sources,
            yet most of which can be conflicting and unreliable.
          </p>
          <h4>User Research and Needfinding</h4>
          <p>
            The demographic that we targeted for research were new parents in
            online discussion forums. A survey was created to assess the type of
            needs our stakeholders had to voice. We found that new parents are
            ill informed going through the maturation process of their baby. The
            following needs reflect the inputs received from users in baby
            parenting facebook groups:
          </p>
          <div class="needfind">
            <ul>
              <li>Track developmental stage with realistic milestones</li>
              <li>
                Suggested Activities/Resources to exceed baby’s developmental
                milestone
              </li>
              <li>Communicate with other new parents</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

            The following persona illustrates the goals and desires of our
            target audience.

            Living in a big city oftens makes her feel isolated and she’s tired
            of constantly calling her doctor and friends for baby advice.
            Danielle wants to have an app which can connect her to the other new
            parents in her area so they can exchange baby tips.

              Having them indicate their baby’s age is crucial to customizing
              the type of information and developmental milestones the user
              sees.

                  After profile creation, users can visit the growth and
                  development milestone tracker, which suggests information
                  relevant to the baby’s current development.

                  This platform bridges the communication gap that new parents
                  experience during the maturation of their baby. Users have
                  access to discussions with other parents, along with expert
                  advice, and informational content detailing the expected
                  experience of baby raising during the specific developmental
                  period.

            <h4>User Testing</h4>
            <p>
              During our user testing stage, we showed our digital prototype to
              stakeholders that resonate with the user persona.The goal was to
              identify any major usability issues with our UI and specific needs
              that can be addressed prior to developing higher-fidelity
              prototypes. The following are key takeaways after testing the
              digital prototype:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>More distinct categories:</b>
                The current categories we had (health, engagement, nutrition,
                sleep), were crucial to maintaining a baby’s growth but parents
                were looking for ways to further exceed developmental milestones
                and nurture their child in new ways.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Easy Access to Community Discussions:</b>
                Users found it simple to post a question about a community
                resource and expressed interest to further interact with other
                users through commenting.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Way to track baby’s health/vitals:</b>
                New parents also showed interest with a UI screen representing
                the baby’s vitals and daily schedule over time. This allows them
                to record the notable interactions they have with their baby.

          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            In the end, my team was able to design a platform for new parents to
            track and gain insight into their baby’s maturation process. We also
            presented our project to our COGS 187A Usability and Information
            Architecture class. In hindsight, I was able to experience the work
            of a UI/UX designer while iterating through the design stages. I’ve
            begun to understand the challenges that designers are faced with in
            creating a novel experience while meeting the goals of users and
            other stakeholders.
